- **Week 1:** Complete Stage 1 (Base Camp) with one team
- **Week 2:** Finalize Stage 2 (The Route) with tool selection
- **Week 3:** Implement Stage 3 (The Climb) with pilot workflow
- **Week 4:** Establish Stage 4 (Check Altitude) tracking

### Scaling the Framework
1. Start with one department or process

| Analysis Paralysis | Limit Base Camp phase to 1 week |
| Tool Overwhelm | Use evaluation framework rigorously |
| Adoption Resistance | Involve teams in Stage 3 design |
| Measurement Confusion | Focus on 2-3 key metrics initially |
