## Purpose & Benefits

This advanced automation streamlines the entire SEO keyword research process by combining the power of AI with professional SEO tools. When a new content idea is added to a NocoDB database, the workflow automatically generates a comprehensive keyword strategy and content brief. It uses AI to expand on a topic, retrieves real-time keyword data (search volume, difficulty) from a tool like DataForSEO, and analyzes competitor content to identify strategic gaps. This saves marketers and content teams a significant amount of time and ensures every piece of content is backed by solid data and a strategic plan.

## Trigger

### Get Input from NocoDB

The workflow is activated by a webhook from NocoDB. When a new row is created in a designated NocoDB table, the webhook sends the record's data to start the automation.

## Workflow Steps & Logic

This is a complex workflow that orchestrates multiple parallel tasks to gather and synthesize data.

1.  **Initial Setup & Notifications:**
    * The workflow is triggered by the NocoDB webhook and immediately extracts the relevant fields (e.g., `primary_topic`, `target_audience`, `competitor_urls`).
    * It then sends a "start" notification to a Slack channel and updates the status of the record in NocoDB to "Started".

2.  **AI Keyword Expansion:**
    * The **`Topic Expansion`** node, an AI agent powered by OpenAI, takes the core topic, audience, and content type to generate a structured list of primary keywords, long-tail variations, question-based keywords, and related topics.

3.  **Keyword Metrics & Competitor Analysis:**
    * The primary keywords are split and sent down two parallel paths to **DataForSEO**. One path retrieves **Search Volume and CPC**, while the other retrieves **Keyword Difficulty**. The results are aggregated and merged back together.
    * Concurrently, the workflow takes a list of competitor URLs and uses DataForSEO to identify keywords they are ranking for. An AI agent, **`Competitor Analysis`**, then analyzes this data to pinpoint content gaps and unique angles.

4.  **Final Strategy Synthesis:**
    * All the data from the previous steps (AI-generated keywords, keyword metrics, and competitor analysis) is merged into a single item.
    * An AI agent, **`Final Keyword Strategy`**, then synthesizes this raw data into a clear, actionable **SEO Content Brief**. This brief is formatted in Markdown with an executive summary, target keyword strategy, competitive landscape analysis, and content outline.

5.  **Final Actions:**
    * The final content brief is written back to a NocoDB table.
    * The status of the original record in NocoDB is updated to "Done," and a "Done" notification is sent to Slack, marking the completion of the automation.

## Credentials Required

This automation requires the following credentials to be configured in your n8n instance:

* **NocoDB API:** To receive the trigger and update the record status.
* **OpenAI API:** To power the AI agents for keyword expansion and strategy synthesis.
* **DataForSEO API:** To retrieve real-time keyword metrics and competitor ranking data.
* **Slack API:** To send notifications for the start and completion of the workflow.
