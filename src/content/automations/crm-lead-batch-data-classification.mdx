## Purpose & Benefits

This workflow automatically qualifies and enriches new leads from your CRM using a third-party property data service, **BatchData**. When a new lead is created, the workflow retrieves property information, scores the lead based on a custom algorithm, and updates your CRM with the enriched data and a qualification status. This automation is invaluable for sales teams, as it ensures immediate focus on high-value leads while reducing manual research time.

## Trigger

### CRM New Lead Webhook

The workflow is activated instantly when a new lead is added to your CRM. The webhook is configured to listen for a specific URL, and your CRM must be set up to send a notification (payload) to this endpoint upon lead creation.

* **Expected Payload:** The webhook expects a JSON payload containing the `leadId`, `crmApiUrl`, and the lead's address information (`address`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`).

---

## Workflow Steps & Logic

This workflow performs several crucial steps to process and qualify new leads.

1.  **Fetch & Enrich Lead Data:**
    * The workflow first uses the `leadId` from the webhook to fetch comprehensive lead data from your CRM's API.
    * It then uses the address information to perform a **property lookup** via the **BatchData API**. This enriches the lead data with valuable property characteristics like estimated value, size, age, and ownership status.

2.  **Score and Qualify Lead (`code` node):**
    * A custom JavaScript code node, `Score And Qualify Lead`, acts as the core of the workflow. It implements a sophisticated algorithm to score the lead based on the enriched property data.
    * **Scoring Factors:** Points are awarded for property value, square footage, property age, ownership status (e.g., investment property), and lot size.
    * **Qualification Thresholds:** The total score determines the lead's final status: **`high-value`** (50+ points), **`qualified`** (30-49 points), **`potential`** (15-29 points), or **`unverified`** if no data is found.

3.  **Update CRM Lead (`httpRequest` node):**
    * The workflow uses an HTTP request to send the enriched data back to your CRM.
    * This update includes the new lead score, qualification status, and specific property details, providing your sales team with all the necessary information in one place.

4.  **Conditional Routing (`if` node):**
    * A conditional `if` node, `Is High-Value Lead?`, checks the lead's qualification status.
    * **High-Value Leads (TRUE Path):** If the lead is classified as `high-value`, the workflow creates an urgent follow-up task in the CRM and assigns it to a senior agent for immediate action.
    * **Standard Leads (FALSE Path):** For other leads, the workflow sends a simple notification to a designated Slack channel, keeping the team informed without creating an urgent task.

## Credentials Required

This automation requires the following credentials to be configured in your n8n instance:

* **CRM API:** Credentials with read and write access to your CRM's API, used for fetching and updating lead data.
* **BatchData API:** An API key for BatchData's Property Lookup service.
* **Slack:** Credentials to send alerts to a specific Slack channel.
