## Purpose & Benefits

This automation is a utility for efficiently managing and sharing files stored in a Google Drive folder. It automatically lists all the files within a specified folder, changes their permissions to be publicly viewable, and generates direct download links for each file. This is highly useful for creating public repositories, sharing files with a large audience, or quickly generating a list of links to be saved in another application.

## Trigger

### Manual Execute Workflow

This workflow is a manual utility that requires a user to trigger it.

* **Trigger:** Manual execution.
* **Setup:** Before running, you must enter the ID of the Google Drive folder you want to process in the `Set Folder ID` node.

## Workflow Steps & Logic

The workflow follows a clear, step-by-step process to list, share, and link your files.

1.  **Set Folder ID (`Set Folder ID` node):**
    * The workflow begins with a `Set` node where you input the ID of the Google Drive folder you wish to process.

2.  **List Files (`Google Drive` node):**
    * The `Google Drive` node queries your account and lists all the files contained within the folder ID provided in the previous step.

3.  **Process Files in Batches (`Loop Over Items` node):**
    * The `Loop Over Items` node processes the files from the folder in manageable batches. This is particularly useful for folders with a large number of files.

4.  **Generate Links & Update Permissions (`Generate Download Links` & `Change Status` nodes):**
    * For each file, the `Change Status` node automatically makes it public by granting `anyone` the `reader` role.
    * The `Generate Download Links` node then constructs a direct download link for that file, which can be shared externally.

5.  **Merge Data (`Merge` node):**
    * The `Merge` node combines the original file metadata with the newly generated public links and permission information.

6.  **Finalize & Store Data (`Replace Me` node):**
    * The `Replace Me` node serves as a placeholder for a final action. You would typically connect a data store node here, such as a Google Sheets, Airtable, or database node, to save the list of file names and their newly generated public links.

## Credentials Required

This automation requires the following credentials to be configured in your n8n instance:

* **Google Drive OAuth2 API:** To access, list, and update permissions for files in your Google Drive.
