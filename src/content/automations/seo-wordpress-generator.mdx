## Purpose & Benefits

This advanced automation is a complete content factory for your WordPress blog, designed to produce high-quality, SEO-optimized articles with minimal human effort. It takes a research query, uses AI to perform in-depth research with Perplexity, and then drafts a comprehensive blog post with a custom copywriter persona. The workflow also handles generating an SEO-friendly title, slug, and meta description, formats the content into WordPress-compatible HTML, and sets a featured image before publishing the post as a draft.

### Key Benefits:
* **Massive Time Savings:** Automates the entire research, writing, and publishing pipeline for blog content.
* **SEO Optimization:** Ensures every post is optimized with a relevant title, slug, and meta description.
* **Consistent Quality:** The AI copywriter agent follows a strict system prompt to maintain a consistent brand voice and content style.
* **Structured HTML:** Creates well-formatted, clean HTML with a table of contents, making posts easy to read and index.

## Trigger

### On form submission

The workflow is activated by a manual form submission.

* **Trigger:** A user manually enters a `Research Query` into the form and submits it.

## Workflow Steps & Logic

This is a multi-stage workflow that handles research, content generation, and publishing in a single automated pipeline.

1.  **Research & Data Cleanup:**
    * **Perplexity Research:** The workflow sends the research query from the form to the **Perplexity API**, a powerful search engine that provides research-backed answers.
    * **Cleanup Links:** This node processes the research output, cleaning up and formatting citations for later use in the blog post.

2.  **AI-Powered Content Generation:**
    * **Copywriter AI Agent:** A dedicated AI agent, with a detailed system prompt defining its persona as a professional copywriter, drafts a comprehensive blog post using the research findings.
    * **Create Title, Slug, Meta:** A separate AI agent generates an SEO-friendly title, slug, and meta description for the post, following specific guidelines to ensure they are optimized for search engines.
    * **Create HTML:** The AI then formats the entire blog post into well-structured, WordPress-compatible HTML, complete with a title, reading time, key takeaways, and a table of contents.

3.  **Image Handling:**
    * **Set Image URL & GET Image:** The workflow uses a placeholder image URL to fetch a featured image.
    * **Upload Image to Wordpress:** The downloaded image is then uploaded to the WordPress media library and its ID is used to set it as the featured image for the post.

4.  **Publishing & Notification:**
    * **Wordpress:** A new post is created in WordPress using the AI-generated title, slug, and HTML content. The post is saved as a `draft`, allowing for a final human review before publication.
    * **Send Success Message to Telegram:** A Telegram message is sent to the designated channel to notify the team that the new blog post has been successfully created.

## Credentials Required

This automation requires the following credentials to be configured in your n8n instance:

* **Perplexity API:** To perform research on a given topic.
* **OpenAI API:** To power the AI agents for content and metadata generation.
* **WordPress API:** To publish the post and its featured image.
* **Telegram API:** To send success notifications.
