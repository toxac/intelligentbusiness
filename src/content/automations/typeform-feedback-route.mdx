## Purpose & Benefits

This automation streamlines the process of collecting and managing feedback from a Typeform submission. It automatically routes responses based on a numerical rating, separating positive and negative feedback into different tabs in a Google Sheet. This saves valuable time on manual data entry and provides an organized, centralized view of customer sentiment.

## Trigger

### Typeform Trigger

The workflow is activated instantly whenever a new response is submitted to a specific Typeform survey.

* **Trigger:** New Typeform submission.

## Workflow Steps & Logic

The workflow follows a straightforward path: capture the data, filter it based on a condition, and then route it to the appropriate destination.

1.  **Capture Typeform Data (`Set` node):**
    * The workflow first captures the key data from the Typeform submission, specifically the `usefulness` rating and the user's `opinion` on the course.

2.  **Conditional Routing (`IF` node):**
    * This node acts as a filter, checking if the `usefulness` rating is greater than or equal to 3.
    * If the condition is `true`, the feedback is considered positive and is sent down the top path.
    * If the condition is `false`, the feedback is considered negative and is sent down the bottom path.

3.  **Log to Google Sheets (`Google Sheets` nodes):**
    * The **positive feedback** is appended to a sheet named `positive_feedback`.
    * The **negative feedback** is appended to a separate sheet named `negative_feedback`. This ensures that all responses are automatically categorized and stored in a logical, easy-to-review format.

## Credentials Required

This automation requires the following credentials to be configured in your n8n instance:

* **Typeform API:** To receive real-time submissions from your Typeform survey.
* **Google Sheets OAuth2 API:** To connect to and append data to your Google Sheets document.
