## Purpose & Benefits

This advanced automation functions as a full-fledged social media content creation and publishing factory. It uses AI to generate platform-specific content and images based on a user prompt, manages content via a centralized approval system, and then automatically publishes it to multiple social media channels. The system's modular design, with prompts and schemas stored in Google Docs, allows for a **flexible content strategy** and **consistent brand voice** across all platforms.

### Key Features:
* **External Prompt Composition:** System prompts and output schemas are stored in Google Docs, allowing non-developers to easily update content guidelines without changing workflow code.
* **AI-Driven Content Creation:** A dedicated AI agent generates tailored content for platforms like X, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
* **Dynamic Image Generation:** The workflow generates a new image for each post based on an AI-generated prompt.
* **Multi-Platform Publishing:** Content is automatically routed to the correct social media API for publishing.
* **Approval System:** An optional email approval step allows for human review of content before it is published.
* **Content Archiving:** All generated content and images are automatically saved to cloud services for future use and compliance.

## Trigger

This workflow has a dual-trigger mechanism that supports two distinct flows:

1.  **Initial Content Generation (`When chat message received`):** This is the primary trigger. A user sends a prompt via a chat message, initiating the content creation process.
2.  **Publishing Flow (`When Executed by Another Workflow`):** This trigger is used to begin the publishing phase after a post has been created and optionally approved via email.

## Workflow Steps & Logic

The workflow is a complex factory with several logical stages.

### 1. Content and Schema Preparation
The workflow first retrieves its instructions from external sources:
* **Social Media Schema:** The workflow fetches a Google Doc containing a dynamic JSON schema for each social media platform.
* **Social Media System Prompt:** It retrieves another Google Doc that defines the AI's role, rules, and style guidelines for each platform.
* These components are then parsed and merged to create a comprehensive prompt for the AI agent.

### 2. AI-Powered Content Creation
* **Social Media Content Creator:** An AI agent receives the user's prompt and the merged prompt/schema. It generates the social media content, including a post, hashtags, and an image suggestion, all formatted to the correct JSON schema.
* **Image Creation:** The workflow uses a service like Pollinations.ai to dynamically create an image based on the AI's image suggestion. This image is then uploaded to a service like imgbb and Google Drive for archiving.

### 3. Content Approval
* **Gmail User for Approval:** The workflow can send an HTML-formatted email to a designated user for review. The email contains a summary of the generated content and image. This is a "send and wait" node, pausing the workflow until a response is received.
* **Is Approved?:** An `if` node checks the response from the approval email. If the content is approved, the workflow proceeds to the next stage; otherwise, it stops.

### 4. Publishing & Routing
* **Social Media Publishing Router:** This is a `switch` node that acts as a central router. Based on the platform requested in the initial user prompt (e.g., `xtwitter`, `instagram`), it sends the approved content and image to the correct social media publishing node.
* **Platform-Specific Posts:** The content is then published to the chosen social media platform via a dedicated node (`X Post`, `Instragram Post`, `Facebook Post`, `LinkedIn Post`, etc.). The workflow uses a variety of APIs to handle image and text uploads for each platform.

## Credentials Required

This automation requires numerous credentials to be configured in your n8n instance:

* **OpenAI API:** To use the AI chat model for content generation.
* **Google Docs OAuth2 API:** To retrieve system prompts and schemas from Google Docs.
* **Google Drive OAuth2 API:** To archive generated images and post content.
* **imgbb API:** To temporarily host images for social media posts.
* **Gmail OAuth2 API:** For the content approval and reporting functionality.
* **Telegram API:** For optional status notifications.
* **Facebook Graph API:** To post to Facebook and Instagram.
* **Twitter OAuth2 API:** To post to X (Twitter).
* **LinkedIn OAuth2 API:** To post to LinkedIn.
