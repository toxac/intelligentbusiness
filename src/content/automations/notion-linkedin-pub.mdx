## Purpose & Benefits

This automation is designed to streamline your social media content workflow by publishing content directly from a Notion database to LinkedIn. The workflow automatically checks your Notion database for a post scheduled for the current day, formats the content, and publishes it, ensuring a consistent and hands-off publishing schedule.

## Trigger

### Schedule Trigger

This workflow is initiated by a schedule trigger, designed to run at a specific time each day.

* **Schedule:** The workflow runs daily at 15:00 (3 PM). You can easily adjust this time in the trigger node's settings.

## Workflow Steps & Logic

The workflow follows a clear, sequential process to identify, prepare, and publish your content.

1.  **Find the Day's Post (`notion` node):**
    * The workflow connects to your specified Notion database and filters the pages to find any entry where the `Date` property matches the current day. This ensures it only processes content that is ready to be published.

2.  **Fetch and Aggregate Content (`notion` & `aggregate` nodes):**
    * Once the correct page is found, the workflow fetches the content blocks from that page.
    * The `Aggregate the Notion blocks` node then combines these blocks into a single piece of content, including both text and any images.

3.  **Format the Post (`code` node):**
    * A custom code node is used to format the raw text from Notion into a clean, readable post suitable for LinkedIn. It handles line breaks and other formatting to ensure the final output looks professional.

4.  **Download Image (`httpRequest` node):**
    * If the Notion page contains an image, this node downloads it so it can be included in the LinkedIn post.

5.  **Publish to LinkedIn (`linkedIn` node):**
    * The `Merge` node combines the formatted text and the downloaded image into a single item.
    * The `Publish on LinkedIn` node then takes this combined data and creates a new post on your specified personal or company LinkedIn profile.

6.  **Update Notion Status (`notion` node):**
    * Finally, the workflow updates the original page in your Notion database. It changes the `Status` property to "Published," providing a clear record that the post has been successfully sent.

## Credentials Required

This automation requires the following credentials to be configured in your n8n instance:

* **Notion API:** To connect to your Notion database to read and update pages.
* **LinkedIn OAuth2 API:** To authenticate and publish posts to your LinkedIn profile.
